### How I worked on this
This is a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/space-tourism-website-project-using-react-and-sass-8GZteTESQ). It is one of the few free premium ones, so I had access to the figma files. I used a `pixel-perfect CSS extension for chrome` to overlay the figma screenshots while I worked on it.

I decided to have _animation-based screen transitions_ instead of hyperlinks to several files. Thus it has just one single page.

### Why I built it this way?

I chose `React` because it is straightforward to setup with `create-react-app`. And figured that the kind of animations I wanted to implement would be easier to think about in terms of components. In the end i didn't really leveraged any React-centric features. Everything in this project could have been done the same in plain HTML. Lesson learned. 

I used `Sass` because I find it easier to organize than plain CSS. But I don't want to rely on CSS libraries like bootstrap. I think proficiency in CSS is an important skill for frontend. Even if you want to end up using libraries, understanding how CSS works will get you in the right frame of reasoning about how frontend works.

### What did I learned?

1. I learned how to code the `"carrousel" technique for sideways transitions.` It is neat, but I had a lot of trouble making sure it worked responsively. As I started with the animations in mind, the "responsiveness" of the website was a debugging nightmare. Lesson learned: start with the responsive part!

2. I learned the `basics of Sass` by building this project. It is really neat! I like it a lot. The nesting feature makes it very easy and intuitive to organize CSS rules. Which can otherwise get really messy really fast.

3. I figured out how to very `quickly add very simple CSS animations.` I got a lot of practice.

4. I learned how to use `GitHub pages`. The live site is hosted here in this repo, on a dedicated branch.

5. I figured out how to setup and use a `pixel-perfect CSS extension`.

### If I had more time...

1. I did not implement to `semitransparent glass-like effect` in the menu. I wasn't able to figure out how. Next time I will focus on figuring it out!

2. While I tried to keep my CSS organized, it still ended up a mess. I will research some `CSS organization methodologies`. 

3. I would like to work a little bit more on the `responsiveness of the site`. But this would require quite a substantial refactor as I did not approached this project with a `"mobile-first"` mentality.
